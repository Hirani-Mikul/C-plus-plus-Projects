1. Check if the Logger is initialized when Writing from the WndProc.
2. Read the comments in every header files.
3. When opening the file for printing, instead of waiting, try destroying the old handle to the opened file.
4. Check why does private methods when called from Setting Procedure Handler, shows the Setting Window Handle as NULL.
5. When the application starts or resumes, it should check in the IN directory for files, if detected, process them.
6. Fix the problem with selecting the printer from the list. Enter & Esc key doesn't work.
7. Implement the functionality of fetching the default printer.
8. In all window and dialog procedures, do something about getting and checking the state, maybe use another function for error checking.
	- To reduce repeatative code.
9. When drawing icons during the WM_PAINT case in the SettingMessageHandler, without returing the default message or empty 
   begin paint and end paint with device context as setting windows handle, the rest of the setting window is not drawn.
	- If 0 is returned, only icons are drawn and other division is not drawn i.e. lable, buttons and etc.
	- Instead of returning default windows message or empty begin and end paint, try to do something standard if possible.
10. Need to change how setting is written and read to and from the config file.
	- If any value in the config file is manually changed to size larger than required, then error will occur.
	- If any value in the config file is changed manually, then the header may also need to be changed manually. 
11. Need to provide functionality to manage the each of the following scenario;
	- If the config file does not exist.
	- If the config file exist, but it's empty.
	- If the config file exist and it's not empty, but the data is not valid.
12. If the input directory is changed after the application has been launched, the directory watcher class needs to create
	new handle to the updated directory and release the old directory handle for monitoring.
13. Instead creating another window and registering the setting window, use dialog box for setting window.
14. Default config file directory is currently defined in the utils.h file "SETTINGS_CONFIGFILEDIR". May change to store it in the Resource String Table.
